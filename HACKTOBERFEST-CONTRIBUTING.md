# Hacktoberfest Contributing 👩‍💻🎃👨‍💻

Happy Hacktoberfest!! This is a guide for contributing to this amazing event.

## General
For those that are not newcomers to GitHub, you can see how to contribute in the [README.md](https://github.com/KAUTH/Retro-Gamez#contributing) file.


## Good first issues

This project is a great opportunity to begin contributing with your first issues. 

For Hacktoberfest we are going to create a series of issues labeled as "good first issue". 

With these issues, more games are going to be added to the existing current list for the Retro-Gamez Firefox extension.

Adding games to the extension:
* Go to [Issues](https://github.com/KAUTH/Retro-Gamez/issues) and find the issues with the "good first issue" label.

* There you will find an id number for the game (*id*), a game title (*title*) and a source link for the iframes that are given as embedded code (*src*).

* Go to the [game_list.js](https://github.com/KAUTH/Retro-Gamez/blob/master/retro-gamez/popup/game_list.js) file. 
 
* Add a new item in the _gameList_ array by giving the *id*, *title* and *src*, that are mentioned above.


## Let's begin!
Don't forget to download the Firefox extension from [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/retro-gamez](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/retro-gamez/) to actually see the project you are contributing to 😉.
